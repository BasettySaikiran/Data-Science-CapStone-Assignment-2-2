# Diabetes Prediction Triangle Model Prototype

This project is designed to build a predictive model for diabetes using demographic and lifestyle data. The model predicts whether an individual is at risk of pre-diabetes, type 2 diabetes, or gestational diabetes based on user input. 
The system is built using a deep learning model deployed through a Streamlit application and stores user data and predictions in a MongoDB database.

The application consists of three main components:

1. Frontend (Streamlit Application)
2. Backend (Deep Learning Model)
3. Database (MongoDB)
